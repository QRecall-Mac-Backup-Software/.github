QRecall for Mac is a **professional backup and archiving tool** designed to protect your data with minimal effort. It works silently in the background, capturing every change to your files and storing them in highly compressed, versioned archives.

Whether you're a creative professional, developer, or business user, QRecall ensures that no important data is ever lost due to accidental deletion, corruption, or system failure.
